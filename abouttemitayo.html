            <h1>About Temitayo Agboola</h1>
            <p>I am from Nigeria, and i studied transport management at the university and currently an operations person.<br>
            <br>I fell in love with Front end development because of my daily interactions with software engineers at my work place.
                Currently learning at the CodeFirstGirls bootcamp and i can assure you that it has been an awesome experience so far.<br>
            <br>I encourage we ladies to join the course of porting into the tech world. Thank you
